Key features include onboarding, secure authentication, a dynamic homepage displaying product categories and new arrivals, detailed product descriptions, cart management, and Razorpay integration for payments. 
Administrators access an exclusive dashboard via Firebase for managing products and users. Android development concepts like fragments, RecyclerView, and Firebase Firestore were applied.
